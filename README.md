# 📚 E-Commerce Book Recommendation System

This project is a personalized book recommendation system designed for e-commerce platforms. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest books to users based on their past interactions and preferences.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In large-scale digital bookstores, users often struggle to discover books that match their interests. This system addresses that challenge by analyzing user-book rating patterns and recommending similar books using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model with cosine similarity.

Built with a modular pipeline and deployed via an interactive **Streamlit** interface, the system ensures fast and relevant book recommendations.

- 🧩 Modular ML pipeline (Data Ingestion → Validation → Transformation → Training → Recommendation)
- 🖼️ Book cover image integration
- ⚙️ Config-driven architecture using YAML
- 🧠 Pre-trained model and serialized data using Pickle
- 💻 Streamlit UI for easy interaction

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Downloads and extracts book dataset from a configured URL.
2. **Data Validation**: Filters users and books based on rating thresholds.
3. **Data Transformation**: Constructs a pivot matrix and converts it to a sparse matrix.
4. **Model Training**: Trains a KNN model with cosine similarity.
5. **Book Recommendation**: Finds and displays top 5 similar books to the one selected.

## 🖥️ Streamlit Interface

Launch the app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Features:
- Select a book from dropdown
- Click "Show Recommendation"
- View top 5 related books with cover images

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integrate content-based filtering using NLP
- Deploy on Heroku / Hugging Face Spaces
- Use deep learning-based recommenders (Autoencoders, Transformers)
- Store user sessions & feedback
- Add multilingual book support
